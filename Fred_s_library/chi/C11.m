% This m-file calculates the cost function value of a theoretical fit to a %real spectrum. Called from Fit_Kb.m to calculate cost function values%with given information. It calls the noise.m function.%% INPUTS: dofc11-> This value, usually =2, is a Chi-squared parameter when%						modelling the errors.%	k_obs  -> This is a vector of k values from the observed spectrum data.%		The vector is x by 1 in size, where x is the number of k values%	S_obs  -> This is a vector of observed spectral values from the spectral%		data. The vector is x by 1 in size, x as before.%	S_theoretical -> This is a vector of the fitted curve spectral values. %	The vector is x by 1 long, with x as before.%%OUTPUTS: costs -> the cost function value for the given observed spectrum%				and theoretical fitted spectrum. function costs=C11(dofc11, k_obs,S_obs,S_theoretical)nois=noise(k_obs);costs=[];C11=[];C11=log( (fc_chi2pdf((dofc11.*S_obs)./(S_theoretical),dofc11).*dofc11./S_theoretical) +eps);%the eps factor is a small matlab number (2.2204e-16) added to prevent the%log operation from producing erros by attempting to take the log of a very small numbercosts=sum(C11);
